# Title: Board Game Quiz
Description: 
We are hoping to create a website that uses a questionnaire to help people figure out what kind of board games they would like and how to play those games. The primary users of this app would be newcomers wanting to get recommendations for board games they should buy in order to start their board game journey. Along with newcomers, the app will also be very beneficial for friends and family who hold frequent game night gatherings. Our app provides a solution for groups that have a hard time deciding what game to play. The questionnaire will map out the different interests and motivations of each user and recommend games that fit that archetype best.
